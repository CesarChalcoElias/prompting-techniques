        "This tutorial introduces Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique in prompt engineering that encourages AI models to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. We'll explore how to implement CoT prompting using OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Motivation**  \n",
        "As AI language models become more advanced, there's an increasing need to guide them towards producing more transparent, logical, and verifiable outputs. CoT prompting addresses this need by encouraging models to show their work, much like how humans approach complex problem-solving tasks. This technique not only improves the accuracy of AI responses but also makes them more interpretable and trustworthy."
