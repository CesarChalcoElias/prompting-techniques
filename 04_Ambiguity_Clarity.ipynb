            "2) Best mode of transportation overall (cost/effort/environment) to get to school\n",
            "   - Criterion: balance of cost, effort, environmental impact, and convenience; could favor walking or biking if feasible, or transit if cheaper.\n",
            "   - What’s implied: you’re choosing between options (walk, bike, car, bus, rideshare) rather than just the route.\n",
            "   - Clarifying questions: What are your constraints (budget, physical ability, weather, parking)? How important is cost vs. time vs. health?\n",

            "3) Safest or most reliable route for a student (e.g., a child)\n",
            "   - Criterion: safety, reliability, well-lit routes, crosswalks, lack of dangerous intersections; may prioritize routes with safety features over speed.\n",
            "   - What’s implied: the user is planning for a student’s commute and wants risk to be minimized.\n",
            "   - Clarifying questions: Is this for a child? Are there school policies or district-approved routes? Do you need a walking route with crossing guards or a bike route with bike lanes?\n",

            "- Depth/scope ambiguity: “explain” can mean a brief, high-level summary or a detailed, formal, step-by-step explanation.\n",
            "- Audience/format ambiguity: it’s unclear who the explanation is for (a layperson, a student, a specialist) and what format is expected (analogy, formal derivation, historical overview, etc.).\n",

            "Three possible interpretations\n",
            "\n",
            "1) Layperson-friendly overview of a specific theory\n",
            "- What this would look like: A concise, accessible explanation of a named theory (e.g., the theory of evolution or the theory of relativity) geared toward non-experts. It would use plain language, analogies, and clear summaries of key ideas, evidence, and basic implications. It would avoid heavy mathematics or formal proofs.\n",
            "- What it would include: Core postulates or main ideas, intuitive explanations, a few key examples or experiments, common misconceptions, and the limitations or scope of the theory.\n",
            "- Example focus: “Explain the theory of evolution to a general audience, with examples like natural selection, variation, and adaptation.”\n",
            "\n",
            "2) Formal, technical explanation (mathematical or rigorous scientific treatment)\n",
            "- What this would look like: A precise, structured exposition suitable for students or professionals in the field. It would include definitions, assumptions, formal statements, derivations, and possibly proofs.\n",
            "- What it would include: Axioms or foundational assumptions, exact terminology, equations or formal models, step-by-step logical reasoning, and conditions under which the theory holds or fails.\n",
            "- Example focus: “Explain the theory of game theory (or graph theory, or general relativity) with definitions, theorems, and proofs, assuming a mathematical audience.”\n",
            "\n",
            "3) Meta or philosophical explanation about what a theory is (philosophy of science)\n",
            "- What this would look like: A discussion about the nature of theories in science—how theories differ from hypotheses and laws, how theories are developed, tested, revised, and sometimes discarded.\n",
            "- What it would include: Philosophical questions about explanation, inference, confirmation, underdetermination, realism vs instrumentalism, and examples of how theories gain or lose acceptance.\n",

            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Context: You are a geographer describing river formations.\n",
            "Clarified response: In river geomorphology, the bank is the land boundary that runs along each side of the river channel. It marks where the active river system ends and the surrounding land begins, and it helps define the size of the channel and the adjacent floodplain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key aspects of a river bank\n",
            "- Materials and shape: Banks are formed from the same sediments carried by the river—clay, silt, sand, gravel, or a mix. Cohesive banks (clays and silts) tend to be steeper and more prone to slow creep, while non-cohesive banks (sands, gravels) are steeper and can fail more abruptly.\n",
            "- Stability and slope: Bank stability depends on soil strength, moisture, vegetation, and groundwater. Saturated banks are weaker and more likely to fail (landslides, slumping, or undercutting by the water).\n",
            "- Bank height and width: The exposed height of the bank above the water varies with river discharge, sediment supply, and erosion. The width between the two banks defines the channel, but on large rivers, the bankline can shift with flood events.\n",
            "\n",
            " Key morphological features related to banks\n",
            "- Cut bank: The outer bank on a bend where fast-moving water erodes the bank, undercutting it and often creating overhangs.\n",
            "- Point bar: The inner bank on a bend where slower flow deposits sediment, building up a leveling terrace that can become a shallow bar.\n",
            "- Floodplain boundary: The bank often marks the edge of the immediate channel, while the broader floodplain extends beyond the banks and is wet or flooded during high flows.\n",
            "- Bankfull line: A commonly used hydraulic reference, representing the water surface at the channel’s bankfull discharge; it helps define the typical channel width and the height to which water rises before spilling over into the floodplain.\n",
            "- Terrace and benches: In some rivers, a more elevated, older streambed sits above the current bank and floodplain as a terrace formed by past channel positions.\n",
            "\n",
            " Processes shaping banks\n",
            "- Erosion: On the outside of bends (cut banks), higher velocities erode sediment from the bank, often causing undercutting and mass wasting.\n",
            "- Deposition: On the inside of bends (point bars), reduced velocity deposits sediment, building up the bank toe and creating new landforms.\n",
            "- Flooding and seepage: High water can saturate banks, triggering failure through seepage, piping, or saturated-soil instability.\n",
            "- Vegetation control: Plant roots bind soil, reduce erosion, and can stabilize banks. However, heavy grazing or removal of vegetation can accelerate erosion.\n",
            "\n",
            " River dynamics and banks in context\n",
            "- Meandering rivers constantly migrate laterally as cut banks retreat and inner banks advance, gradually shifting the position of the bankline and the boundary with the floodplain.\n",
            "- In straight reaches, banks may still erode or accrete, but the processes are less dramatic than in meandering sections.\n",
            "- Over longer timescales, bank processes contribute to terrace formation, oxbow lakes, and the evolution of the floodplain.\n",
            "\n",
            " Ecological and human implications\n",
            "- Habitat: Banks host vegetation, in-stream trees, and bank-side habitats important for wildlife. Erosion can destroy habitat quickly, while stable banks support diverse ecosystems.\n",
            "- Flood risk and water quality: Bank erosion can increase sediment loads, affecting water quality and aquatic habitats. Conversely, healthy banks reduce erosion and filter runoff.\n",
            "- Engineering and management: People stabilize banks to protect infrastructure, farmland, and towns using methods such as riprap, gabions, retaining walls, or bioengineering (willow fascines, coir logs, live stakes). Re-vegetation and setbacks from the bank are common strategies to reduce erosion and restore natural processes.\n",
            "\n",
            " How geographers study banks\n",
            "- Field measurements: cross-sections, bank angle, bank height, soil shear strength, and vegetation cover.\n",
            "- Remote sensing and mapping: LiDAR and aerial imagery to detect bankline position, erosion rates, and channel migration over time.\n",
            "- Hydrologic and sediment models: simulate how discharge, sediment supply, and bank stability interact to drive erosion or deposition.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific river type (meandering temperate river, braided river, or mountain torrential river) or provide examples of typical bank erosion rates and stabilization strategies for a given region.\n",

            "\n",
            "Equipment\n",
            "- Oven capable of high heat (preferably 500–550°F / 260–290°C)\n",
            "- Pizza stone or steel (optional but helps with a crisp bottom)\n",
            "- Large bowl, wooden spoon or stand mixer with dough hook\n",
            "- Rolling pin (optional; best results come from hand-stretched dough)\n",
            "- Baking sheet or pizza peel\n",
            "\n",
            "Step-by-step directions\n",

            "- In a large bowl, mix the flour and yeast. Gradually add the lukewarm water while stirring.\n",
            "- When a shaggy dough forms, add the salt (and oil, if using). Knead by hand 8–10 minutes (or 6–7 minutes in a stand mixer) until smooth and elastic.\n",
            "- If the dough is very sticky, sprinkle in a little more flour, but aim for a soft, tacky dough.\n",
            "- Shape into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled (about 1–2 hours at room temperature; or refrigerate for 12–24 hours for more flavor, then bring to room temperature for 1–2 hours before shaping).\n",
            "\n",
            "2) Prepare the sauce (while dough is rising)\n",
            "- Crush the tomatoes by hand or with a quick pulse in a blender until you reach a chunky consistency.\n",
            "- Stir in salt (and oil if using). Taste and adjust with a pinch of sugar if desired.\n",
            "- Do not cook it long; a bright, fresh-tinished sauce is traditional for Margherita.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) Preheat the oven\n",
            "- Place a pizza stone or steel in the oven and preheat to the highest setting (around 500–550°F / 260–290°C) for at least 30 minutes. If you don’t have a stone, you can bake on a heavy-duty baking sheet brushed with a little oil.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) Shape the dough\n",
            "- Lightly flour a work surface. Gently press the dough to a rough disk, then use your hands to stretch it outward into a 12-inch circle. If you prefer, roll it, but hand-stretching helps keep the air pockets for a lighter crust.\n",
            "- Create a thicker edge or lip (the crust) about 1 inch wide.\n",
            "\n",
            "5) Assemble the pizza\n",
            "- Lightly flour a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet. Transfer the dough.\n",
            "- Spoon about 3–4 tablespoons of sauce onto the center of the dough, then spread in a thin layer outward, leaving a about 1-inch border.\n",
            "- Tear or slice the mozzarella and distribute evenly over the sauce.\n",
            "- Scatter a few fresh basil leaves (reserve some for finish) and drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil if you like.\n",
            "\n",
            "6) Bake\n",
            "- Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone/steel or bake on a hot sheet.\n",
            "- Bake until the crust is crisp and blistered and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 7–10 minutes depending on oven heat and thickness of the crust. If you’re using a home oven at max temp, watch closely after 7 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "7) Finish and serve\n",
            "- Remove from oven. Immediately scatter the remaining fresh basil on top.\n",
            "- Drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired and season with a light pinch of salt.\n",
            "- Cut into wedges and serve hot.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tips and variations\n",
            "- If you’re short on time, you can skip long fermentation: use 500 g flour, 320 ml water, 1–2 g instant yeast, 10 g salt; knead, rest 15–30 minutes, portion into two rounds, and proceed with toppings.\n",
            "- For a more traditional Neapolitan-style result, use 00 flour and a slower, cooler fermentation (12–24 hours in the fridge) to develop flavor.\n",
            "- Fresh mozzarella can release water. If you find the dough getting soggy, dry the mozzarella gently with paper towels before topping.\n",
            "- If you don’t have San Marzano tomatoes, high-quality crushed tomatoes or a good passata work well. Salt is essential to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.\n",
            "- A hot oven mimics a wood-fired oven. If you don’t have a stone, bake on the middle rack of a very hot oven and finish under a broiler for a minute if you want extra bubbling.\n",
