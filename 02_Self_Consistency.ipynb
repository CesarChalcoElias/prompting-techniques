        "Large language models can sometimes produce inconsistent or unreliable outputs. By leveraging multiple reasoning paths and aggregating results, we can enhance the robustness and accuracy of AI-generated responses. This approach is particularly useful for complex problem-solving tasks where a single path of reasoning might be insufficient or prone to errors."

All three reasoning paths describe the same core idea: price coordinates the decisions of two sides of the market (buyers and sellers).

Shortages arise when the price is too low to clear the market, and surpluses arise when the price is too high.\n",

            "- Movements vs. shifts:\n",
            "  - Movement along curves: Caused by a change in price.\n",
            "  - Shifts of curves: Caused by non-price factors (income, prices of related goods, tastes, expectations, number of buyers; input costs, technology, prices of related outputs, expectations, subsidies/taxes, number of sellers).\n",

            "Strengths:\n",

Acknowledge these as caveats to avoid overgeneralization.\n",
            "- Time and dynamics: Equilibrium is presented as a static concept. In reality, short-run vs. long-run dynamics, adjustments over time, and expectation formation can shift curves or alter how quickly an equilibrium is reached.\n",
            "- Price controls and non-price rationing: The analysis touches on shortages/surpluses arising from price relative to equilibrium, but does not explicitly distinguish price ceilings/floors (government interventions) that can create persistent shortages or surpluses even if “the” equilibrium exists in theory.\n",
            "- Elasticity details: The mention of elasticity is appropriate, but expanding to specify types (price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, cross-price, income elasticity) and how different elasticities affect the slope and responsiveness could deepen understanding.\n",

        "* This approach usually achieves state-of-the-art performance, but a the cost of a lot of extra tokens in comparison with other strong techniques like CoT.\n",
        "* It's slower because the user has to wait while the model thinks/generates the N paths of reasoning.\n",
        "* It's considerably more expensive because we pay for each generated path.\n",
        "* It's even less deterministic because we rely on multiple non-deterministic answers as inputs which can add random noise to the aggregation LLM.  \n",

        "* This is a solid approach for complex problems like math problems, as well as a powerful tool to get a robust 'I don't know' as answer if there's no concensus about the response.  \n",

        "* For creative use cases where there's no one solid ground truth.\n",
        "* For extraction or classification problems where without this technique the performance is above the baseline is wasteful to loose time trying this slower approach where the gain is won't be enough.\n",
        "* There are some models like OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek-R1 that already has a self-consistency check before show the answer to the user, so apply this technique over those models makes no sense at all."
